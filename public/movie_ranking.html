    <h1>The Best Movies According to Prashant</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Exorcist (directed by William Friedkin and released in 1973)</h3>
<p>I'm obsessed with "The Exorcist" because it's seriously one of the best horror flicks ever made. Everything in it, from the creepy vibes to the characters, is just spot on. The actors, especially Linda Blair as Regan, totally nail their roles and give you chills. But what really gets me is how it digs into big ideas like faith, doubt, and the whole good vs. evil thing. It's not just about scaring you—it makes you think and feel. And even though it's been around for ages, "The Exorcist" still holds up as a total classic that's left its mark on horror movies forever.</p>

<h3>Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2014)</h3>
<p>I adore "Interstellar" because it's this awesome mix of sci-fi and human stories. Christopher Nolan's direction is just amazing, making every scene look incredible and making you think hard. The movie dives into big ideas like love, sacrifice, and exploring space, all while Earth is falling apart. The actors, especially Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, really make you feel for their characters. What's so cool is how "Interstellar" makes you ponder the universe while also keeping you on the edge of your seat with its epic adventure. It's the kind of movie that sticks with you, making you wonder about space and the strength of people long after it's over.</p>

<h3>The Conjuring (directed by James Wan and released in 2013)</h3>
<p>I'm totally hooked on "The Conjuring" because it's just so dang scary! James Wan knows how to freak you out with every scene, keeping you jumping out of your seat. But what really gets me is how much they care about the characters, especially Ed and Lorraine Warren. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are awesome, making the spooky stuff feel totally real. Plus, they use practical effects and cool camera tricks that make it all feel super authentic. "The Conjuring" is basically a lesson in how to do horror right—it's full of suspense, heart, and enough scares to give you nightmares for weeks.</p>
